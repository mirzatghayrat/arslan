"""L7-5: a goal's `check:` lines, run by the host at each verdict (docs/plans/0164/L7-goal-mode.md, "Check files are
protected from Start: verify, then run in place"; "Fit with LOOP1").

Each line runs as a host call through `_run_tool`, as `_presearch` does, with the arguments the model would send for
the same command (`{"command": ...}`): the same admission and budget, plan mode, command gate (`_never_runs`,
`_where_it_runs`, `_card`, `_network`, `_own_folder_holds`), sandbox and cards. Nothing is pre-approved, and no
subprocess is started here. It runs in place, in the working folder, only after the protected set verifies, and the set
is hashed again right after. Its records go to a copy of the turn's (as a parallel read's do), so the worker's trace
never holds the host's run: only the verdict reads it (`host_runs`), and the next round gets what it printed."""

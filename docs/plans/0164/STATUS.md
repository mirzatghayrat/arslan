# v0.1.64 status (one page)

Kept by ⓪Plan; updated after each merge. The plan and cards are in [README](README.md). The v0.1.63 page is [`docs/plans/0162/STATUS.md`](../0162/STATUS.md); its "Codex 待审" section (which Codex model, the prompt to paste, the queue) still applies.

**Updated:** 2026-10-29, evening.

## Ready for the user to merge

Both of the user's batches are merged, and main is green after each one. Nothing is ready yet; these are in review:

- **#475 (INB2):** the effort=max recheck at `40e8a8ab` said merge after fixes. ②Main fixed H3 and H4 at `8834ed0a`. The user picked H1 "trace notes back" and H2 "count the project card" (2026-10-29), and ②Main is building both, tests first. The same reviewer then rechecks. Security surface: the user merges.
- **#486 (Q1b, Bridge frames):** the effort=max review at `9249401a` asked for small changes. F1: a retry must repeat `conversation_kind`, and the Bridge refuses a kind-changing resend. F2: the id regex must end with `\z`. F3: four test gaps. With ②Main. Bridge surface: the user merges.
- **#490 (Q1 #3, migration 0078):** ⓪Plan's effort=max reviewer is on it. Security surface (when Arslan learns): the user merges.
- **#491 (Hands outcome words):** deletion-only, `no_effect` kept (`desktop_open` still says it). ②Main reviews, then auto-merge.

**Who merges (#467):** sessions auto-merge docs, plan cards, bench scripts, tests and deletion-only PRs outside the security surface, after another session's OK on the current head and green checks. The user merges the security surface and ordinary product code. For SB1 and WB1, the user's approval also lets the author auto-merge.

## In progress

| Lane | Work |
|---|---|
| ②Main | Q1b #486 (Bridge frames; ⓪Plan's effort=max reviewer on `9249401a`), Q1 #3 (migration 0078), then the pocket deletion (the old pocket stays a Mac-only conversation; every phone frame naming it is refused, inbound and outbound: #487). INB2 #475: the user's F2 (allowlist) and F4 (`sensitive: true`) at `40e8a8ab`, main merged in at `4420c21a`; ⓪Plan's effort=max reviewer is rechecking `4420c21a..40e8a8ab`. Then Q1b (Bridge frames, `sent_at`), then Q1 #3 (conversion boundary, migration 0078), then the pocket deletion. #483 logs migrations 0078/0079 |
| ③Hands | **SBX-2 goes to Codex, whole** (user, 2026-10-29, the cloud audit's split; #493). ③Hands' local SBX-2 branch stays untouched. ③Hands writes 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7 and 8 and S2a-3's structure, and starts drafting after #493 merges. #491 drops `partly_done` and `refused`, keeps `no_effect`; ②Main OK'd it at `c71045b2` (effort=max), and auto-merge is on. Its first backend run 40811544026 failed only in cargo-deny's advisory-db download (pytest 9732 passed), and the job was re-run. The 0076 table-drop PR is unblocked now that #459 is merged (`a528c3ff`). FRONT1 waits on the user's pick |
| ⑤CAP | CAP2b (0077), unblocked now that #472 is merged |
| ①iOS | Q1c in progress, on the scope the user narrowed on 2026-10-29 (Q1 card): 快问 replaces 「＋ 新对话」, one thread page, a 30-minute follow-up window, no 转成对话 on the phone yet |
| ⑥Helper | STY #452 (draft), SIDE after SUB2, SB1 after the pocket deletion and INB4 (mock first) |
| ⓪Plan | M64, STY read tally, mid-version M1 round, cards; the docs-site Cua sentence in the v0.1.64 docs pass |

## Waiting on the user

- **Release secrets into an Environment:** once the user has the originals of the updater's private key and the Apple certificate, move every `APPLE_*` and `TAURI_*` secret into a GitHub Environment that needs the user's approval, and add `environment:` to both workflows. After that, Codex may push by itself (plan B).
- **SBX-2:** paste the SBX-2 task to Codex (plan A); it can start today.
- **FRONT1:** which trigger Hands' `front` parameter names, from ③Hands' four options (README §3.6).
- The pocket is deleted in v0.1.64 only if Q1c ships with Mac 0.1.64; the TestFlight upload needs the user's nod.
- The STY read page: the user exports the choices (JSON) to ⓪Plan, which tallies them.
- Real-Mac checks: FS1 (#451) and the Hands smoke for F5b-2 (#456), both on `SMOKE.md`.
- Making the `language` CI job a required check (④参谋 is walking through it).
- The one mock for SIDE-0 and WB1, and the sidebar mock SB1-0, when they come.

**Decided on 2026-10-29:** the classifier pass lines are complete (≥ 70% of the approvable scope answered; ≤ 5% failure fallback), and C7c Q1–Q4 are answered (experts become skills automatically in the migration; private knowledge goes to the general base with a label; the v1 views and `/brain/proposals*` go in v0.1.65; `list_spawns` is removed now). Recorded in #474. Also decided on 2026-10-29: INB2 F2 is an allowlist and F4 is an optional stricter-only `sensitive: true`; the Bridge passes the envelope `ts` as `sent_at`; a converted quick ask learns from the conversion on; the pocket goes in v0.1.64 if Q1c ships with it, else v0.1.65 (recorded in #482). The pocket's old messages stay as a Mac-only conversation (#487). The sidebar card SB1 is in v0.1.64, and projects double as groups in v0.1.65 (this PR).

## Codex to write (user, 2026-10-29)

**Why:** a safety classifier stopped ③Hands as it started SBX-2. The user had the cloud audit split SBX and S2a-3, and approved the split. What Claude cannot write goes to Codex (SBX card, "Who writes what"). Reviews: Astra (highest level) in a new Codex session, never the session that wrote it. Claude reviews the non-probe plumbing. The existing review queue is in [`docs/plans/0162/STATUS.md`](../0162/STATUS.md), "Codex 待审".

**Where the chain is stuck:** SBX-2 (Codex). HR, CLS, S5a and S5b wait on it; see README §4, "Reordered 2026-10-29". ③Hands does other owed work meanwhile. Its local SBX-2 branch stays untouched.

**How Codex delivers: plan A (user, 2026-10-29, final for now).** Codex writes and commits locally and does not push. The ChatGPT Codex Connector keeps its current access, which does not include `arslan`. The user pushes Codex's branch and opens the PR. The rules stay the same:
- branches start with `codex/`, and PRs carry the label `codex`;
- every commit message and PR body says "Author: Codex (model, reasoning level)" and names the reviewer;
- PRs carry the four evidence items (`docs/sessions.md` §8) and the macOS CI run id;
- Codex never merges, never pushes tags, and never changes `.github/`;
- the user merges every Codex PR, since all of them are on the security surface.

**Pushing a Codex branch (the user runs this).** Run it in the folder where Codex worked, which is Codex's own checkout of `arslan`, after Codex says its branch is committed. `<branch>` is the branch Codex names, for example `codex/sbx2-default-deny-base`. `<body file>` is the PR body Codex wrote, with the four evidence items.

```bash
git status
git log --oneline origin/main..<branch>
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --repo mirzatghayrat/arslan --base main --head <branch> --label codex --title "<title Codex gave>" --body-file "<body file>"
```

- Before pushing, `git status` should be clean, and the log should show only Codex's commits.
- The first time only, create the label: `gh label create codex --repo mirzatghayrat/arslan --description "Written by Codex"`.
- Then tell ⓪Plan the PR number. Claude reviews the plumbing, and Astra reviews the rest.

**Later, plan B (Codex pushes by itself):** only after the release secrets are protected (see "Waiting on the user").

**Why plan B waits (⓪Plan and ②Main, 2026-10-29):** giving the connector write access would include workflows and Actions. Two workflows read the repository's secrets, and both have `workflow_dispatch`: `release.yml:32` and `secrets-preflight.yml:26`. Those secrets include the updater's signing key (`release.yml:132-133`). With that access, Codex could dispatch either workflow on a `codex/` branch, which runs that branch's edited copy, or push a branch that adds a workflow of its own. `release.yml`'s guard (`:25-26`, no `pull_request` trigger) only protects against fork PRs. `ci.yml` reads no secrets.
The fix, for when the user has the originals, is to move the secrets into a GitHub Environment:
- the Environment holds every `APPLE_*` and `TAURI_*` secret;
- its lock is a required reviewer, you. A "`v*` tags only" rule is not a lock when the same login can push tags;
- both `release.yml`'s job and `secrets-preflight.yml`'s job name the Environment, or they lose the secrets.
That is a repository-settings change. The `environment:` lines for the two workflows are proposed at the same time, not before.

**The tasks (one paste per block).** Each task points to card sections only. Codex designs the tests' content itself from the card; nothing here spells it out.

| Block | Paste this to Codex | Ready? |
|---|---|---|
| SBX-2 | "Write SBX-2 for mirzatghayrat/arslan on a local `codex/` branch. Commit, don't push; the user pushes and opens the PR. Read `docs/plans/0164/SBX-sandbox.md` in full, then do the SBX-2 row of 'PR split' with the scope in 'Who writes what', §1, §2 and §M. Build on SBX-1's builder (`server/services/sandbox_profile.py`, merged). Make the harness parameterised by base name. Not wired to any entry point. Real-seatbelt tests run on the macOS CI job. Follow `docs/sessions.md` §5, §8, §9 and §12. Write everything in English. Put 'Author: Codex' and the reviewer in each commit, and write the PR body to a file with the four evidence items; the macOS CI run id is added once CI has run." | **Yes** |
| SBX-3p … 6p | "Write SBX-Np (N = 3, 4, 5 or 6): read the SBX card's 'Who writes what' and the SBX-N row and sections it names, then write the real-seatbelt tests that what SBX-N should deny is denied, as parameters of SBX-2's harness. No product code." | After SBX-2 and SBX-M; 6p only with SBX-6 |
| Allowlist after SBX-M | "Read the SBX-M report (`docs/plans/0164/SBX-measurement.md`) and the SBX card §2; propose the allowlist change it calls for, ≤ 50 lines." | After SBX-M |
| S2a-3 tests | "Read `docs/plans/0162/S2a-command-three-layers.md` (S2a-3) and the S2a-3 row of `docs/plans/0164/README.md` §3; write the test content named there for #375 / #376 / #378 / #396 and #406, against the rebased heads." | After SBX-7 and ③Hands' rebase |

## Spend

- M64 baseline round `r64-m64-base`: about $1.71 at DeepSeek peak prices.
- STY read test `sty1-ds`: two rounds of 20 prompts, small (within the proxy caps).
- DeepSeek proxy total since its last start: about $8.0 of its $20 cap.

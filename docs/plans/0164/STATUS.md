# v0.1.64 status (one page)

Kept by ⓪Plan; updated after each merge. The plan and cards are in [README](README.md). The v0.1.63 page is [`docs/plans/0162/STATUS.md`](../0162/STATUS.md); its "Codex 待审" section (which Codex model, the prompt to paste, the queue) still applies.

**Updated:** 2026-10-30, evening.

## Ready for the user to merge

Only PRs with an independent effort=max OK **at the current head** and green CI are listed here. All of them are on the security surface, so the user merges each one.

1. **#490** (Q1 #3, migration 0078) at `b9acf73b`: it merges #475 and #486 in, and adds the PUT-lock and `kind_of` guard follow-up. CI 41021432398 is a success. **Ready once ⓪Plan's reviewer's final glance says OK** (it's running).
**Next, not ready yet (don't merge these):**

2. **#512** (FRONT1: A plus the corrected B) at `e3a46233`. It conflicts with main, so ③Hands is syncing it, and ⓪Plan's reviewer is rechecking the fixes for F1–F3. Not ready.
4. **#507** (SBX-2, Codex): not ready. Its macOS job has 3 real failures for Codex to fix, and the plumbing review asked for fixes. Astra's review is the user's to start. **#508** (ci.yml 69 → 359) is OK'd; the user merges it into the Codex branch.

**Who merges (#467):** sessions auto-merge docs, plan cards, bench scripts, tests and deletion-only PRs outside the security surface, after another session's OK on the current head and green checks. The user merges the security surface and ordinary product code. For SB1 and WB1, the user's approval also lets the author auto-merge.

## In progress

| Lane | Work |
|---|---|
| ②Main | #490 (waits on the reviewer's final glance). The pocket-deletion PR (committed; it opens as a draft once its suite is green, and waits on the user's go) |
| ③Hands | #512 sync and recheck. SBX-3a is draft #520 (part 1; the private TMPDIR next; it doesn't merge before SBX-2 and SBX-M). Then 4a, 5a, 7, NAME1, TITLE1. The ci.yml bump to 362 for #507 |
| ⑤CAP | SKF1 is #519 (effort=max review on `e6b339ce`), then UNI1a (the backend; UNI1b's notice needs a mock first), then SEC1 and MCPOUT1 |
| ⑥Helper | WB1-1 merged (#517). STY #452 rebased (a draft until the user's read). Next: WB1-2 (Overview), then WB1-3 |
| ①iOS | Q1c is done: build 30 is on TestFlight (the user OK'd it on 2026-10-29). An independent review of its Bridge contract commit is running. The real-Mac end-to-end needs a 0.1.64 dev build on the user's Mac |
| Codex (via ⑦Codex) | SBX-2 #507 fixes |
| ⓪Plan | Reviews as PRs open (#490, #512, #519, #507 plumbing, iOS bde7b9f); STATUS. The cut proposal #515 was not adopted |

## Waiting on the user

- **Merges:** the "Ready" list above, in that order.
- **The STY read, once more:** the exported verdicts are from an earlier page (`3a107ed670ba`), and every row in them is empty: the export happened half a minute after that page was made. So the read hasn't been done yet. Re-read `sty-read-v0164.html` and export again. STY stays in draft until then.
- **SB1-0 mock picks:** the sections (match the iPhone, or add 30 days), a time on rows or headings only, and Pinned above or below Projects. (WB1's tab name is decided: Working folder.)
- **SB1 raw material:** a read-only count of conversations by section. ⑥Helper's query was blocked, so the user runs it or allows it.
- **SBX-2 (#507):** relay the macOS failures and the plumbing findings to Codex; start the Astra review session; merge #508 into the Codex branch.
- **Real-Mac checks:** Quick Chat end to end with build 30 (needs a 0.1.64 dev build and pairing); FS1 (#451); the Hands smoke for F5b-2 (#456).
- **Release secrets into an Environment** (plan B for Codex), once the user has the originals of the updater's private key and the Apple certificate.
- **Making the `language` CI job required:** #504 merged with it red. That's a repository setting, so the user does it.
- **A session card from ②Main:** "Make the chat liveness tests load-tolerant" (②Main is doing it now).

**Decided on 2026-10-29:** the classifier pass lines are complete (≥ 70% of the approvable scope answered; ≤ 5% failure fallback), and C7c Q1–Q4 are answered (experts become skills automatically in the migration; private knowledge goes to the general base with a label; the v1 views and `/brain/proposals*` go in v0.1.65; `list_spawns` is removed now). Recorded in #474. Also decided on 2026-10-29: INB2 F2 is an allowlist and F4 is an optional stricter-only `sensitive: true`; the Bridge passes the envelope `ts` as `sent_at`; a converted quick ask learns from the conversion on; the pocket goes in v0.1.64 if Q1c ships with it, else v0.1.65 (recorded in #482). The pocket's old messages stay as a Mac-only conversation (#487). The sidebar card SB1 is in v0.1.64, and projects double as groups in v0.1.65 (this PR).

## Codex to write (user, 2026-10-29)

**Why:** a safety classifier stopped ③Hands as it started SBX-2. The user had the cloud audit split SBX and S2a-3, and approved the split. What Claude cannot write goes to Codex (SBX card, "Who writes what"). Reviews: Astra (highest level) in a new Codex session, never the session that wrote it. Claude reviews the non-probe plumbing. The existing review queue is in [`docs/plans/0162/STATUS.md`](../0162/STATUS.md), "Codex 待审".

**Where the chain is stuck:** SBX-2 (Codex). HR, CLS, S5a and S5b wait on it; see README §4, "Reordered 2026-10-29". ③Hands does other owed work meanwhile. Its local SBX-2 branch stays untouched.

**How Codex delivers: plan A (user, 2026-10-29, final for now).** Codex writes and commits locally and does not push. The ChatGPT Codex Connector keeps its current access, which does not include `arslan`. The user pushes Codex's branch and opens the PR. The rules stay the same:
- branches start with `codex/`, and PRs carry the label `codex`;
- every commit message and PR body says "Author: Codex (model, reasoning level)" and names the reviewer;
- PRs carry the four evidence items (`docs/sessions.md` §8) and the macOS CI run id;
- Codex never merges, never pushes tags, and never changes `.github/`;
- the user merges every Codex PR, since all of them are on the security surface.

**Pushing a Codex branch (the user runs this).** Run it in the folder where Codex worked, which is Codex's own checkout of `arslan`, after Codex says its branch is committed. `<branch>` is the branch Codex names, for example `codex/sbx2-default-deny-base`. `<body file>` is the PR body Codex wrote, with the four evidence items.

```bash
git fetch origin
git status
git log --oneline origin/main..<branch>
git diff --stat origin/main...<branch> -- .github
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --repo mirzatghayrat/arslan --base main --head <branch> --label codex --title "<title Codex gave>" --body-file "<body file>"
```

- Before pushing, check three things:
  - `git status` is clean;
  - the log shows only Codex's commits;
  - **the `.github` diff prints nothing.**
- If the `.github` diff lists anything, don't push. In plan A your push is the only gate. A pushed branch's workflows run with the repository's secrets (only fork PRs are cut off), so tell ⓪Plan; a Claude session makes any workflow change in its own PR (②Main's review of #497).
- The first time only, create the label: `gh label create codex --repo mirzatghayrat/arslan --description "Written by Codex"`.
- Then tell ⓪Plan the PR number. Claude reviews the plumbing, and Astra reviews the rest.

**Later, plan B (Codex pushes by itself):** only after the release secrets are protected (see "Waiting on the user").

**Why plan B waits (⓪Plan and ②Main, 2026-10-29):** giving the connector write access would include workflows and Actions. Two workflows read the repository's secrets, and both have `workflow_dispatch`: `release.yml:32` and `secrets-preflight.yml:26`. Those secrets include the updater's signing key (`release.yml:132-133`). With that access, Codex could dispatch either workflow on a `codex/` branch, which runs that branch's edited copy, or push a branch that adds a workflow of its own. `release.yml`'s guard (`:25-26`, no `pull_request` trigger) only protects against fork PRs. `ci.yml` reads no secrets.
The fix, for when the user has the originals, is to move the secrets into a GitHub Environment:
- the Environment holds every `APPLE_*` and `TAURI_*` secret;
- its lock is a required reviewer, you. A "`v*` tags only" rule is not a lock when the same login can push tags;
- both `release.yml`'s job and `secrets-preflight.yml`'s job name the Environment, or they lose the secrets.
That is a repository-settings change. The `environment:` lines for the two workflows are proposed at the same time, not before.

**The tasks (one paste per block).** Each task points to card sections only. Codex designs the tests' content itself from the card; nothing here spells it out.

| Block | Paste this to Codex | Ready? |
|---|---|---|
| SBX-2 | "Write SBX-2 for mirzatghayrat/arslan on a local `codex/` branch. Commit, don't push; the user pushes and opens the PR. Read `docs/plans/0164/SBX-sandbox.md` in full, then do the SBX-2 row of 'PR split' with the scope in 'Who writes what', §1, §2 and §M. Build on SBX-1's builder (`server/services/sandbox_profile.py`, merged). Make the harness parameterised by base name. Not wired to any entry point. Real-seatbelt tests run on the macOS CI job. Follow `docs/sessions.md` §5, §8, §9 and §12. Write everything in English. Put 'Author: Codex' and the reviewer in each commit, and write the PR body to a file with the four evidence items; the macOS CI run id is added once CI has run." | **Yes** |
| SBX-3p … 6p | "Write SBX-Np (N = 3, 4, 5 or 6): read the SBX card's 'Who writes what' and the SBX-N row and sections it names, then write the real-seatbelt tests that what SBX-N should deny is denied, as parameters of SBX-2's harness. No product code." | After SBX-2 and SBX-M; 6p only with SBX-6 |
| Allowlist after SBX-M | "Read the SBX-M report (`docs/plans/0164/SBX-measurement.md`) and the SBX card §2; propose the allowlist change it calls for, ≤ 50 lines." | After SBX-M |
| S2a-3 tests | "Read `docs/plans/0162/S2a-command-three-layers.md` (S2a-3) and the S2a-3 row of `docs/plans/0164/README.md` §3; write the test content named there for #375 / #376 / #378 / #396 and #406, against the rebased heads." | After SBX-7 and ③Hands' rebase | More decided on 2026-10-29 and 2026-10-30, all by the user:
- #475 H1 "trace notes back", H2 "count the project card", and old notes fail closed;
- #486 G1 "server fails closed";
- #495 "mark odd MCP tool names";
- #496 "split by source";
- MCP tool descriptions from an approved server stay unmarked, as a stated limit;
- the English name is "Quick Chat";
- Codex works under plan A.

**Decided on 2026-10-30 (user, relayed by ④参谋):**
- **Deletable scope:** skills Arslan wrote (`authored` and `authored-outside`) and connections the user added by hand may be deleted, as #499 and #500 built them. Built-in and seeded items stay non-deletable (409). The deleted skill's text goes to the Trash.
- **The long-term approach over minimal patches:** cards SKF1, UNI1 and SEC1 (README §3.12).
- **FRONT1:** options A and B, in one PR (user, 2026-10-30, in ③Hands' chat). ③Hands is building it; it merges after #475.

**Not adopted (user, 2026-10-30):** the v0.1.64 cut (#515). The user's words: 「现在没有按"截断方案"吧，我不太想一直有任务推到后面只为了快上线新版本 我只是想要合理推进 不要老是原地踏步」. The scope stays as planned. What the user wants is steady, visible progress: every lane busy on its next card, reviews in parallel, no PR left idle on a sync or a review, and Codex's next SBX block queued as soon as the previous one lands. Progress is reported as PRs merged per round and what moved on the critical path.

## Spend

- M64 baseline round `r64-m64-base`: about $1.71 at DeepSeek peak prices.
- STY read test `sty1-ds`: two rounds of 20 prompts, small (within the proxy caps).
- DeepSeek proxy total since its last start: about $8.0 of its $20 cap.

"""D4 (docs/plans/0162/D4-osascript-not-authorized.md): an osascript to one app that macOS or the app
refused as "not authorized" is a known failure: nothing happened in that app.

K1's before/after runs, T1: osascript told Reminders to make a list, Reminders answered -10004, the
model switched to EventKit and succeeded, yet the task stopped at "needs your review" because any
failed command matching an outbound rule (apple-events) counted as "outcome unknown".

Verified before writing this (2026-10-20, recorded in the PR): from a sender Reminders refuses, a
read, a write and a read-then-write all fail at the FIRST data access with -10004, and no list was
created. -10004 is therefore all-or-nothing for Reminders; other apps raise it on their own terms
and stay unknown. -1743 (Automation not allowed) blocks every event to the app.
